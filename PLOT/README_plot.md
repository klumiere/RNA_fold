# PLOT folder

At the end, in the subfolder training_pdb_files will contains files named as:
- `di_nt.txt`: files with score a give base pairs among the 20 (AA, AU,..,GG)
- `di_nt_plot.png`: file the plot for each base pair among the 20 (AA, AU,..,GG) with score in fonction of the distance interval as the following example for 

  


The first type of file will be used to calculate the score for the PDB 2O3Y.
